# Viola Theatre
We were given the opportunity  to cooperate with the small but very significant prague theater Viola located on Národní třída in Art Nouveau building. The theatre is focused on chamber performances inspired by literary texts and has rich cultural heritance continuing to the day.

## Dates
November-January 2022 (shool assigment)

## Role
My role in the team od three (together with Jan Jiráček and Eunice Sojková) was to focus on the potential of social media, printed programs and cocreating whole conception. We won 2nd place with this project. Our logo was combined with the winnig design. 

## Outcome
Ideation, identity, branding, social media strategy, print layouts 

Client’s request was to make overall communication more attractive and united including logo, website, all printed materials and  strategy for social media. Our objective was to appeal to younger viewers, but also not scare the usual older clientele.
- show their previous communication

## Solution
In our design we decided to enhance special aspects of the theater such as unique closeness to the artists and the emphasis on the beauty of the czech languge. We play with the word proximity in the typography. The colors are in the form of warm gradients inspiried by theater lights, also cozy atmosphere and abstract emotions during the performance. Why it works ? 

## Takeaway
This project wassuprisingly challenging beacause of the creative freedom in comparassion with serious corporate projects. We were as a team often tangled in different ideas and inspiration. At the end we figured out the way based on strong communication story.
