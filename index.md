## My Story

![Anna working on a notebook .](about-me-photo.jpg)
This is me

 I am graphic design student currently pursing final year of my bachelor studies. Since I was born I was leaning towards arts and crafts of all various kinds such as painting, photos, pottery and even tattoo making.

In my work as a designer I am mostly focused on visual identites. My dream job would probably revolve around use of illustration however as you will see later in my diverse style works ,I am still trying to explore all possible diciplines of graphic design and find my special place. I love to educate myself in courses and still moving foward. I hope to bring little gentleness and thoughtfullness to every project that I am part of. 

When I am not behind computer screen or working on my projects, I love to move my body in yoga poses,spent time with my dogs outside or discover new design coffe shops with friends.
